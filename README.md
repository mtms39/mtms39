Hi, I’m a undergrad student at Federal University of Minas Gerais who is driven by learning and challenges.
I'm studying Physics on college and Data Scinece by my self.

Looking for a carreer on Cybersecurity I'm always reading about it and/or making a free course.

If you want to find me, you can contact me through my e-mail: marcotuliomelosoares@gmail.com.
